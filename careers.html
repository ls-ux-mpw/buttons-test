			<h1>Work with Lovesac</h1>

			<p>Think of a slightly madcap family. Think of an over-enthusiastic start-up that&#39;s already made it. Think of the entrepreneurial spirit running, unbounded, everywhere we sell Sacs and Sactionals. However you think of Lovesac, working here is unlike any other job or company experience. Think about spending every workday of your life changing the way people think about furniture. We&#39;re always interested in hiring smart, hard-working, entrepreneurial and fun people at Lovesac. So have a look below for open positions or sign up for alerts to be notified when new positions become available.</p>
